## Location
For ease of use with connecting different programming technologies to the database we decided to host the database
on campus at NAU.  This allows for heigtened security and ease of connection by the main group members while maximizing
the uptime of the server.

## Software
We are using the software provided by NAU.  We were provided with a shell to access and edit the database which requires
multiple forms of authentication.  This shell connects us to a SQL back end allowing us to use standard SQL to create, 
edit, and maintain the database.
