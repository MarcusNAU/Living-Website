# Living Website

We provide a backend framework for creating an adaptable navigation system for websites that updates links automatically based on popularity. This framework can be attached to any website in order to provide a client’s site with more adaptability. Our system improves customer satisfaction when they navigate through our client’s website, while personalizing the user experience. The main function of the framework is an automatically updating navigation bar. Our product will log user activity and track which navigation items are accessed most often. It will use this information to reorder the items in the navbar based on popularity. The project also includes an example website to demonstrate the functionality of the framework. The current version of the framework can log user activity and send that information to the database. It can also generate updated HTML files based on user activity, though currently they have to be manually applied.
