# D3 Analysis

## System Description

A common problem shared by many website designers is in structuring their website in a manner which makes navigation easy. As a result, attempting to find a specific page on certain websites can turn into a 15 minute challenge rather than a simple click. Our product aims  to solve this problem by providing a personalized website to those who use online shopping. It is designed to create a faster shopping  experience that prioritizes what the consumer may need or want to look for. The theme of the site is centered around the SCP foundation, a fictional organization which collects and catalogs supernatural entities. While users will not actually be able to purchase anything as our product is fictitious, our site will serve as an example for web designers in how to design a user-friendly navigation system. We provide an effortless shopping experience for those who enjoy making purchases online through a seamless and customer orientated navigation system.
The **home**, **SCP**, and **sort results** pages, are all designed to be easily understood and accessible to all who access it. We have a **navigation bar** that shows the most clicked elements on the website as well as a *search bar* that will help all users easily find the information they desire. The **SCP** and **search results pages** are designed to be similar to the **home page** for easier comprehension. For example, the home page has a center area where it explains what the page is. When changing from that to an scp page, all of the *links* will remain the same and  only the contents of the center will change. This ensures that all pages on the website remain easily accessible as the navigation of the website and search feature remain in the same areas on the website and create consistency between pages.  
The applications we are using, such as **changeHTML** and **databaseConnection**, will be designed using C++ and will be in charge of connecting  to and viewing entities from the database and creating an updated **HTML file**. The way this will be done is by setting a timer to run every Sunday and ***check the database*** for any updated navigation entities such as the *number of clicks* and the *number of items*. If there are entities that need to be updated then the application will check the current **HTML file** and make adjustments to the **navigation bar** based  on the information in the **database**. This cycle will repeat on a weekly basis and will allow for the user to manually upload the updated **HTML files** if they wish to update the website.  
The database will hold the information pertaining to the **SCPs**, usage data for popular links and purchasing information. The main part of the database will be the **SCP** object. This will contain all relevant information about **SCPs** such as *name*, *containment class*, *risk class*, and other important data. The database will also contain the *popularity of certain links* to facilitate the ***changing of links***. The database will facilitate the payment process for the **SCPs** by holding *credit card information* temporarily, unless otherwise specified, and other information about the purchase such as which and how many **SCPs** were ***purchased***.
